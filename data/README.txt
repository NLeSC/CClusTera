Use this data set (rename the folder drom data_artificial to data, after you
have renamed the original data folder to data_original) for a better
demonstration of the visualization software. 

The artificial data is created by creating a distance matrix where the
average distances within a cluster decrease exponentially with increasing hte
clustering level, and by embedding the distance matrix also hierarchically
using the Stochastic Proximity Embedding algorithm.
